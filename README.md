# Friends

a quiz about the TV show 'Friends' , using ASP.NET MVC, the C# programming language.

An xml file contains 60 questions (with answers) about the TV show "Friends", and my applications takes randomly 10 questions from it. The user answers each question at a time, and after it saves the score in a xml file for users. The application on the top users score action, shows only the first top ten scores from the file.

The question is not repeated in the same quiz, and after the user choses his answer, immediatly find out if the answer is correct or wrong.

The questions don't have the same points in value, suggesting that each question has different value.

In the future, I am thinking to make a quiz on levels, from easy to hard, but the score of each question to be the same.
